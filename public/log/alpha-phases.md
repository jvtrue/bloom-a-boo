Right now, the game is just a basic foundation. You can design a ship, fly it around, fight others, and warp from place to place. Today I'll outline features that will be added afterwards. I won't alter the plan without warning, but keep in mind any of this can change. Don't count on anything until it's completed.

Each phase is an experiment, the result of which will inform the next. Phases will be playable by alpha testers. Even the first phase will function as a simple but complete game within itself.

### Combat Phase

The purpose of the combat phase is to make sure the game's basic combat mechanics are solid. Line of sight will be implemented so ships can hide from each other. A basic set of attributes for frigates, cruisers, and battleships will be established and balanced. New weapon types will be introduced and tested.

Players will be able to capture territory for one of three predefined alliances. When a location is captured it will gradually fill with space stations designed by the players who control it. At this time, stations will only serve a cosmetic function, being a sign of who has recently controlled a location.

### Social/Economic Phase

The three static alliances will be replaced by player created groups and alliances. This phase will introduce the economy. Each alliance will have to gather and manage resources to function in the galaxy.

Stations will gather asteroids and other resources from their vicinity. Resources will be gradually broken down into materials. These materials will be used to create stations, ships, ammo, fuel, or other supplies.

Player groups will have control over their microeconomies. They'll be able to assign roles to players, control who can use or buy resources, and offer rewards to players who complete different events. These options will be controlled by a [JSON](http://json.org/) API. Preset economic systems will be available for groups not interested in doing their own programming.

### Research Phase

In this phase, research will be introduced to the game. Players will be able to construct research stations. These stations will be used to discover new technology. Technology will be procedurally generated and infinite. (More on that later.) There will always be something new to discover.

The timeline to comlete all three phases is not concrete. However, the combat phase will begin soon after the Kickstarter campaign is over. Contested Space will start small and become more complex over time.
