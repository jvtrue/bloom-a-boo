Right now Contested Space is a prototype. I made it as a test to prove that I could program an online game. Past this point I'll be endeavoring to make Contested Space into more of a game. Contested Space is about creating unique interstellar cultures. The starting point is to allow players to collect resources and to build their own stations.

This is a preview of how basic resource collection and stations will work in Contested Space. I'm trying to create the simplest possible economy. Contested Space will start with basic game play systems and elaborate on them as the game matures.

## Starting from Scratch

When players start the game from scratch they'll be given a frigate for free. Player will be able to design their own starting frigates, but they must meet certain requirements. Starting frigates must have a pair of mining and construction turrets and must be under a maximum cost.

## Mining and Minerals

Minerals are the fundamental resource in Contested Space. Everything will have a mineral cost unless you want to start over with a free starting frigate. Mining will be a simple point and shoot affair. Minerals will be deposited into the ship's hold and may be used to construct structures.

<!-- I'm not a fan of mining in space games. It's just too tedious to do for a long period of time. Eventually players will be able to create mining drones to do the work for them, but drones won't be added to the game in the next release. We'll be focusing on the initial experience of starting out and building your first station. -->

## Stations

Stations serve as storage and as a respawn point. Small stations will be fairly inexpensive to build, but they'll also be easier to destroy. Stations will have limited storage space so you won't lose a ton of resources if one is destroyed. The idea is to allow players to build a decentralized network of stations spread out over a wide area.

## Constructing Structures

To create a structure you'll select one of your designs and position it in space. It will then appear as a single cube. At that point you'll pour resources into the structure using a construction turret. The structure will build itself using the design you selected as resources are added.

## Destroying Structures

Structures will be immune to turret fire from frigates and cruisers. Battleships will be used to take out structures. However, battleships will cost more to build compared to a small station. So aggressors will have more at stake compared to defenders.

## Other Game Mechanics

There are a few other features I'd like to include in this release, but they won't be reveled until after mining and stations have been implemented. I'll continue to post here as I make progress.
