I make a living as a web developer. That's how I pay the bills while working on Contested Space. However, I've been on the lookout for jobs in the game industry. Ideally I could sharpen my game development skills while getting paid.

Recently I've been given an opportunity to work with Facepunch on [Rust](http://playrust.com/). I'll be working with them on a trial basis for 3 months. I can't risk losing my normal income if the Rust trial doesn't work out. So during the trial I'll continue my previous job as a web developer.

Work on Contested Space will be put on hold during the Rust trial period. The plan is to resume development on Contested Space afterwards. At that point I'll resign as a web developer and my schedule will be again open for side projects.

Contested Space and Rust have a lot in common. They both are multiplayer sandbox games, running on Unity, with HTML UIs. They both use a fair amount of dynamic and procedurally generated content. I'll essentially be working on the same sort of problems full time. Both projects could greatly benefit if this arrangement works out.
